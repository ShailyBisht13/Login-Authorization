# Login-Authorization
This is a front-end demonstration of a Login Page implementing a mock Authorization Code flow (inspired by OAuth 2.0 with PKCE).
It uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript only, without any server-side logic.
The goal is to help beginners understand how the Authorization Code + PKCE process works in theory.
Features:
1. Modern, responsive login UI

2. Email/password validation

3. “Remember Me” option using localStorage

4. Show/hide password toggle

5. Generates a random authorization code after login

6. Simulates exchanging the code for a mock JWT token

7. Fully client-side — no backend required

8. Detailed code comments explaining each step
